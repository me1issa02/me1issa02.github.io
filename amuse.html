        <h1>Internet Humor</h1>
        <p>My humor is all over the place, thanks to the internet I am able to find videops I find funny all throughout many different sites and platforms.</p>

        <h2>Top Laugh</h2>
        <p>When I think of funny videos, the first thing that usually comes to mind are Instagram reels because I never fail to find something funny when I scroll on reels. I've Linked one of my favorites below.</p>

        <h2><em>Sometimes</em> Fresh Laughs</h2>
        <p>Reddit is a great place to find fresh new laughs.  The Jokes subreddit has a mix of old and new jokes to keep things funny.  However, I can't always vouche for how clean the jokes are...</p>

Fortunately, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/">Way Back Machine</a> website is constantly "crawling" websites and backing them up for posterity.  Here's a copy of http://www.chuchnorrisfacts.com from 2015:</p>
