        <h1>Social Media Humor</h1>
        <p>My humor is all over the place, thanks to the internet I am able to find videos I find funny all throughout many different sites and platforms.</p>

        <h2>Top Laugh</h2>
        <p>When I think of something, the first thing that usually comes to mind is Instagram because I never fail to find something funny when I scroll.  I've linked a funny meme page below.</p>

        <h2><em>Classic</em> Laughs</h2>
        <p>Another thing that comes to mind when thinking of something funny is America's Funniest Home Videos. Watching these as a kid would never fail to make me laugh and even today I tend to find some of these videos funny.</p>

        <h2>Yo Momma</h2>
        <p>If there's one thing that contributed to my humor as a kid was "yo momma" jokes. Although these jokes ten to be offensive, there are still some funny ones out there and you shouldn't take these jokes to heart. Below I've linked a website full of various "yo momma" jokes that 13-year-old me would find hilarious.</p>
